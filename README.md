# Petopia

Petopia is a web-based application designed for pet data management, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on pet data. With Petopia, users can create, read, update, and delete pet records with ease. The application is backed by a server that mocks the database.
This application serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in Angular, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, showcasing my skills and knowledge in frontend development.

## Features

- Create new pet records
- View existing pet records
- Update pet information
- Delete pet records

## Technology Stack:

- Frontend: Angular, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Backend: Mocked server using NodeJS and ExpressJS.

## Getting Started:
- Clone the Petopia repository: git clone https://github.com/gabyamaciel/Petopia 
Navigate to the project directory: cd petopia
- Install dependencies: npm install
- Start the application: npm start
- Access Petopia in your browser at: http://localhost:4200

## Development server

To run the backend server, follow these steps:

1. Open your command-line interface.
2. Navigate to the backend/ directory of the Petopia project using the cd command. For example: cd backend/
3. Once you are inside the backend/ directory, run the following command to start the server: node server.js
4. The backend server will start running and listen for incoming requests.

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine before running the server. If you haven't installed Node.js, please visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) to download and install the latest version compatible with your operating system.

After starting the backend server, you can access the Petopia application in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000 or as configured in the server.js file.

Note: Keep the backend server running while using the Petopia application to ensure the proper functioning of CRUD operations and data management.

## Usage
- Upon launching Petopia, you will be able to view the existing pet records.
- Use the application to add new pets, providing all necessary details.
- Update pet information by selecting the respective pet and modifying the desired fields.
- Remove pets from the records by deleting their entries.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
